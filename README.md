This project involves a deep learning comparative analysis focused on predicting spatial movements, specifically analyzing wolf movements in Alberta, Canada, using geographical coordinates. The study evaluates the effectiveness of various models, including RNN, LSTM, GRU, and others, in forecasting wolves movement patterns using Python. By comparing these models, the project aims to identify the most accurate approaches for understanding and predicting spatial dynamics in ecological systems.
